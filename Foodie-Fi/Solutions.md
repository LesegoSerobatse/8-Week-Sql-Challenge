### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

### B. Data Analysis Questions

1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS 'No. of customers Foodie-Fi ever had'
FROM subscriptions
```

## C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

   - monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
   - upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
   - upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
   - once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```SQL
